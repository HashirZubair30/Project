          <span style="text-align: center;"> <h4>Great Wall of China</h4></span>
          <span style="color:rgb(51, 156, 156)"> <p>The Great Wall of China  is a series of fortifications that were built across 
             the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against 
             various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls<br> were built from as early as the 7th
              century BC, with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first
               emperor of China. Later on, many successive dynasties built 
               and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. </p></span>

             amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the
              largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world,
               despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD)  and was
                completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus.</span>
